ðŸ’» I've worked for companies large and small, I've started and sold my own [companies](https://inoxoft.com/), [built apps](https://techcrunch.com/2013/12/05/offline-blends-text-audio-and-writer-empowerment-to-create-new-kind-of-ios-publication/), etc... and worked for huge Mega-Corps (like Johnson & Johnson, and Procter & Gamble).

ðŸ¤“ I am the author of [AI Harmony](https://aiharmony.info), a published [computational neuroscientist](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11571-008-9054-0) and have been thinking about machine learning and neural networks than longer than I care to admit. I am also married to a [brilliant PhD in Psychology](https://www.widener.edu/about/faculty-directory/elisa-esposito) who keeps me honest about any scientific extrapolations I make from my models.

ðŸŽ“ I love to learn and am continuously taking continuing education courses ðŸ™„. Most recently I have been taking courses at [MIT](https://executive.mit.edu/course-finder), [Wharton](https://executiveeducation.wharton.upenn.edu/for-individuals/all-programs/general-management-program/) and also watch many [O'Reilly movies on AI/ML](https://www.oreilly.com/playlists/discover/) for fun. I don't know everything, but I can look almost anything up and learn it when I need to.

ðŸ™Œ I love to teach and help people get into the [best career in America](https://www.businessinsider.com/what-its-like-to-be-a-data-scientist-best-job-in-america-2017-9). I started by teaching my [little sister](https://github.com/emflaugh) how to be a developer and has expanded to [annual bootcamps](https://bradflaugher.com/bootcamp.html) with students from around the world.
